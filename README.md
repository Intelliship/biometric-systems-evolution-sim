# Biometric Systems Evolution Sim

Abstract simulation of system engineering principles for biometric system modernization and lifecycle evolution.

This project interprets a real-world job description into a working systems design template. It captures the thought process of transitioning legacy biometric infrastructure into modern, scalable architectures using versioned evaluations, refresh roadmaps, message testing, and performance tracking.

Sanitized for GitHub.
